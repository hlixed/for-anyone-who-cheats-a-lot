# For Anyone Who Cheats A Lot

You know how there's that puzzle mode in the mii plaza? The one that requires ridiculous numbers of play coins to even have a chance of filling out a single panel? Well, I don't agree with it one bit. Run this little tool to set your daily Play Coins directly to 300 automatically. Never again will you need to experience the horrible grindfest that is Puzzle Swap.

Building:
After installing ctrulib and devArm and all that other good stuff, just run command-line 'make'. Copy the resulting .3dsx and .smdh files to a new folder named for-anyone-who-cheats-a-lot in the 3ds/ folder.

Inspired by and forked from iamevn's [for-anyone-who-walks-a-lot](https://github.com/iamevn/for-anyone-who-walks-a-lot)

If you want there's also a prebuilt 1.0 release in the releases tab above.
